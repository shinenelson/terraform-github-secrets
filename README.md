## Doc generation

Code formatting and documentation for variables and outputs is generated using
[pre-commit-terraform
hooks](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform) which uses
[terraform-docs](https://github.com/segmentio/terraform-docs).

Follow [these
instructions](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform#how-to-install)
to install pre-commit locally.

And install `terraform-docs` with `go get github.com/segmentio/terraform-docs`
or `brew install terraform-docs`.
